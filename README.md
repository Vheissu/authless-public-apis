# authless-public-apis
A collection of API's that do not require authentication, for developers wanting to learn a new framework, library or service and requiring some data to work with. Real data is always better than mock data.

These API's are publicly accessible and require no account creation or authentication tokens to use. Please refer to documentation and API services themselves for limitations.
